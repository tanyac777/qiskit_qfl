# Quantum Federated Learning Experiments with Contextual Bandit
## RESEARCH FOCUS
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging concept that aims to unfold federated learning (FL) over quantum networks, enabling collaborative quantum model training along with local data privacy. This paper enlarged the evolving field of QFL, 
focusing on quantum neural network and its advantages on FCB. After implementing QFCB in Genomic dataset, we found QNN can reduce the number of parameters while still having good and even better results, and thus improve the communication efficiency and performance in federated setting.
To simulate real-world conditions, we also include various types of quantum noise in our experiments. We analyze the impact of these noise on the algorithm, and thus pave the way for the future real-world quantum applications. 


##### A high level view of local learning in the proposed QFL Process consisting of several key components. The Feature Map ingests input data and encodes it into a quantum state. Following this, the Ansatz comes into play as a parameterized quantum circuit, with its parameters being iteratively fed by the Optimizer--optimization objective function is driven by the outcomes from the Sampler.
